                <h3>Module 4 Challenge - Building a blog</h3>
                <span>In this project, I built 2 pages from scratch for a user to insert blog posts. After submission, there is a second page where users can read their posts and other posts. Users also have the option of viewing the page in a dark mode or a light mode with a simple click on the sun/moon in the top right corner.</span>

                <h3>Module 6 Challenge - Weather Dashboard</h3>
                <span>In this project, I built a weather dashboard with the use of a server-side API. Users are able to search for any city and the 5 day forecase will appear along as the current weather data.</span>

                <h3>Group Project</h3>
                <span>In this project, my team and I created a trivia game using 2 APIs: a trivia API and a random dog image API. Everytime the user answers a question, a random image of a dog pops up on the page! We also created a modal that can be executed through the settings button in the top right corner.</span>
