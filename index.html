            <p class="snail">I am 24 years old and I live in Philadelphia. I graduated from The George Washington University in May 2022.
                I live an active lifestyle. I have completed 3 half marathons and I work at a yoga studio, enjoying the discounted membership.
                For fun, I enjoy reading and hanging out with my friends.

                    <h3>Module 4 Challenge - Building a blog</h3>
                    <span>In this project, I built 2 pages from scratch for a user to insert blog posts. After submission, there is a second page where users can read their posts and other posts. Users also have the option of viewing the page in a dark mode or a light mode with a simple click on the sun/moon in the top right corner.</span>
